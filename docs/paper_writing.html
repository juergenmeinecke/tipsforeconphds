<h2>Essential Reading<a class="headerlink" href="#essential-reading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A strongly opinionated piece is offered by <strong>Cochrane, John H.: Writing Tips for PhD students,
2005</strong>, available online somewhere. Full of interesting opinions. Read selectively.</p>
<p>Another useful one is <strong>A Guide to Writing in Economics</strong> by Paul Dudenhefer. A correlated version
of this text may be <strong>On Economics Writing</strong> by the same author. Both are available online, check
them out.</p>
<p>If you want to sharpen your English writing skills (and you should!), you must read <strong>Strunk and
White. The Elements of Style</strong>. A classic.</p>
<p>Another good one <strong>Thomson, William. A Guide for the Young Economist, 2nd edition, Cambridge: MIT
Press, 2011.</strong> Here the sales pitch: <em>This book is an invaluable handbook for young economists
working on their dissertations, preparing their first articles for submission to professional
journals, getting ready for their first presentations at conferences and job seminars, or
undertaking their first refereeing assignments.</em></p>

<h2>General tips<a class="headerlink" href="#general-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Presume that you do not know how to write a good paper</p>
<p>Principles of good writing: simplicity, clarity, unity</p>
<p>Simple is better. Most students think they have to dress up a paper to look impressive.  The exact
opposite is true: The less math used, the better. The simpler the estimation technique, the better.</p>
<p>Use <em>active</em> tense, not passive. Not: “it is assumed that <span class="math">\(\tau=3\)</span>, “data were constructed as
follows..”</p>
<p>Instead: &#8220;I assume that <span class="math">\(\tau=3\)</span>&#8221; and &#8220;I construct the data as follows&#8221; (yes, you may use the
first person singular, although often times single authors do not do this)</p>
<p>Present tense is usually best. You can say “Fama and French 1993 find that” even though 1993 was
a while ago. The same goes for your own paper; describe what you find in Table 5 not what you will
find in Table 5. Most importantly, though, keep the tense consistent.  Don’t start a paragraph in
past tense and finish it in the future.</p>
<p>Do not use adjectives to describe your work: “striking results” “very significant” coefficients,</p>
<p>If you must use adjectives, do not use double adjectives. Results are never “very novel.”</p>
<p>Revise, revise, revise</p>
<p>How long should the paper be? Make it as long as it needs to be: no longer, no shorter</p>
<p>Do not try to fool your reader; your readers are sophisticated academics and are likely to see
through any such strategies</p>
<p>Demonstrate the originality and significance of your contribution: show that what you did has not
been done before and that your conclusions are not direct consequences of known results</p>
<p>Do not make your paper more important than it is</p>
<p>Do not generalize; it is tempting to broaden the scope of the paper when in fact it only addresses a
narrow research question</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="title">
<h2>Title<a class="headerlink" href="#title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Resist the temptation to have a popular or funny or witty or clever sounding title</p>
<p>Resist the temptation to have a very opaque or abstract or mathematical sounding title</p>
<p>Resist the temptation to make the title very short</p>
<p>Resist the temptation to make the title very long</p>
<p>The title should simply describe what you are doing</p>
<p>Make sure the title will be understood and is recognizable to people who work in your field</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abstract">
<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Potential readers look at your abstract for appetizers; they will decide based on the abstract
whether they will read the rest of the paper</p>
<p>Same holds for seminar or conference attenders</p>
<p>Keep the abstract short, about 150 words (unfortunately, in reality you will find that many
abstracts easily exceed this word count)</p>
<p>Dare to omit! The abstract cannot offer a comprehensive summary of the paper; necessarily it must
omit important things; be brave!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Introductions and conclusions can be the most difficult parts of papers to write</p>

<p>Explain what you are doing better and how are you doing it</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Summarize your results up front</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You or your supervisor may ask you to write a literature review as well</p>
<p>The lit review could be either a subsection in the introduction or it could be its own freestanding
section following the intro</p>
<p>If you do write a lit review, remember this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Do not merely enumerate articles; provide genuine discussions</li>
<li>Take time and space to discuss papers that are closest in spirit</li>
<li>Make sure you summarize these papers accurately</li>
<li>The authors of these papers are likely to be your referees</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Decide how general or broad your opening should be. Keep in mind that even a “big picture” opening
needs to be clearly related to your topic;</p>
<p>Try writing your introduction last. You may think that you have to write your introduction first,
but that isn’t necessarily true, and it isn’t always the most effective way to craft a good
introduction.</p>
<p>The writing process can be an important way to organize your ideas, think through
complicated issues, refine your thoughts, and develop a sophisticated argument.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to write a tentative introduction first and then change it later.</p>
<p>Open with an attention grabber. Sometimes, especially if the topic of your paper is somewhat dry or
technical, opening with something catchy can help</p>
<p>Be straightforward and confident; believe in your own research and sell it that way (or otherwise I
will not believe in your research)</p>

<div class="section" id="body-of-an-empirical-paper">
<h2>Body of an Empirical Paper<a class="headerlink" href="#body-of-an-empirical-paper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Usual structure of body: Data; Model; Estimation Techniques; Findings</p>
<div class="section" id="describing-your-data-and-their-sources">
<h3>Describing Your Data and Their Sources<a class="headerlink" href="#describing-your-data-and-their-sources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In empirical economics papers, it is customary to describe the data one uses</p>
<p>The best way to learn about writing a data section is to read several data sections in the
literature on your topic and pay attention to the kinds of information they contain</p>
<p>Most data sections are short—a page or so.  What you tell your readers about your data will depend
in large part on the kind of analysis you are conducting</p>
<p>Generally speaking, however, your data section should do at least the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identify the data source. This means a sentence that explicitly says where your data come from
(e.g., “This study uses data from the 1999 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.”).</li>
<li>Describe the data source. You should tell your readers such things as the number of observations,
the population groups sampled, the time period during which the data were collected, the method of
data collection, etc.</li>
<li>State the strengths and weaknesses of the data source. How do your data compare with other data
sources used in the literature? Does yours provide more observations, and/or more recent
observations, than other sources? Was the data collected in a more reliable manner? Why is the data
source particularly suited (or not) to your study?</li>
<li>Note any features of the data that may affect your results.  Were certain populations
overrepresented or underrepresented? Is there attrition bias or selection bias? Did the method of
data collection change?</li>
<li>Explain any computations or adjustments you made.  Sometimes, a data source does not give you
something directly; you perhaps had to add/subtract/multiply/divide two given pieces of data to get
a third. Describe how you constructed your sample.  Did you have to eliminate certain kinds of
observations, for instance?</li>
</ul>
<p>Data sections often contain a table of descriptive statistics,
statistics of relevance about the sample. These statistics usually
include the mean (e.g., mean income, mean age, mean years of
schooling, etc.) and standard deviation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="describing-your-model">
<h3>Describing Your Model<a class="headerlink" href="#describing-your-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Economic analysis largely concerns the construction and testing of models. Models are abstract,
simplified representations of an economy, of a function (such as a utility function), of a decision-
making process, and so on; they are expressed in a combination of words and mathematics.</p>
<p>It is customary in empirical economics papers to have a section devoted to describing your model.
Although the length of the description varies from paper to paper, a typical model section in an
empirical paper will be four or five pages long.</p>
<p>If the paper presents a simple regression, the model might simply be the regression equation.</p>
<p>More complicated papers might present notation, develop a basic model of economic behavior, report
the first-order conditions necessary for agents’ to optimally set prices or choose investment or
whatever, and then interpret those conditions.</p>
<p>In the model section, the writer takes the reader through the series of equations that constitute
the model.</p>
<p>The description should begin verbally.</p>
<p>You should lay out all the assumptions you make in your model,</p>
<p>Explain the intuition behind those assumptions</p>
<p>In your models, the notation should either (a) follow the standard notation in the literature or (b)
be very self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Use <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="describing-your-estimation-methods-and-techniques">
<h3>Describing Your Estimation Methods and Techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#describing-your-estimation-methods-and-techniques" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Models often contain constants or parameters whose values need to be estimated</p>
<p>How will you estimate the parameters? What technique will you use?</p>
<p>The length and detail with which you describe your methods will be determined by the complexity of
your analysis.</p>
<p>For example, if you are just doing OLS then there is no need to explain to the reader how OLS works
(this can be assumed as known)</p>
<p>The same is true for 2SLS or IV estimation</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you develop your own estimator then you need to be 100% transparent about how
this works</p>
<p>If you use somebody else&#8217;s fancy estimation technique (of which you cannot assume that average
readers will be familiar with) then you can refer to the paper from which you borrow that technique
and, in addition, provide the basic mechanics/outline of how this particular technique works</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="findings">
<h3>Findings<a class="headerlink" href="#findings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The results section of an empirical paper is usually the longest</p>
<p>In an empirical economics paper, you test a model with data; in the results section, you report the
outcome of that test.</p>
<p>What are the answers to your research questions?</p>
<p>What is the relationship between your dependent variable and the several independent variables you
have chosen to examine?</p>
<p>Does the model “fit” the observed data?</p>
<p>In most cases, when you report the results of your analysis, you are at the same time referring the
reader to a table in which the results are presented.</p>
<p>When you present information in a table, there are at least two expectations that you need to
fulfill.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Explicitly introduce the table</p>
<p>Briefly indicate the table&#8217;s
general content.</p>
<p>Example: <em>Table 1 shows the incomes earned by full-time
workers in the United States,</em></p>
<p>or <em>In table 1, I present the results of
the three regressions that explore the relationship between income
and education.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Identify the main points made by the data in the table,
the points that most closely correspond to your research question.</p>
<p>The table cannot, and should not be expected to, “speak for itself.”</p>
<p>Tell the reader what the table says</p>
<p>Example: <em>Table 1 reveals several significant
characteristics of our sample that could affect our results: one-third
of women in the sample had less than a high-school education;
nearly two-thirds were unmarried; and exactly one-half had at least
one child under 3,</em></p>
<p>or <em>As expected, the coefficient on education
is, in every regression, significant and positive.</em></p>
<p>Point out counterintuitive results</p>
<p>Do not discuss each and every little aspect of the table</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to describe the contents of the table in the text</p>
<p>You cannot simply refer to a table (or worse, not refer to it at all!) and leave it at that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conclusions should be brief</p>
<p>Do not simply restate (or copy and paste) from abstract and/or intro. (Rather don&#8217;t bother writing a
conclusion.)</p>
<p>Basic things you can put in</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>restate research question</li>
<li>restate main findings (not too much detail!)</li>
<li>discuss policy implications</li>
<li>point out extensions and future research (without undermining your current paper)</li>
</ul>
<p>But a conclusion could be much more: it is your chance to concisely sum up your paper from a fresh angle;</p>
<p>Place to suggest other lines of inquiry or broader implications of the topic and findings that you
didn’t have the space to explore.</p>
<p>Careful: do not open new cans of worms!</p>
<p>Helps answer the question: So what? Why should readers care?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bibliography">
<h2>Bibliography<a class="headerlink" href="#bibliography" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Make sure you include all citations from the paper in your references</p>
<p>Do not include any references if they have not been mentioned in the paper</p>
<p>Always use the most recent version of a paper available</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digression-tables-in-papers">
<h2>Digression: Tables in Papers<a class="headerlink" href="#digression-tables-in-papers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tables are excellent for presenting a large amount of data in a
concise, easy-to-read form</p>
<p>A well-designed table can communicate in brief what may otherwise take several paragraphs if
presented textually, and can do so more clearly.</p>
<p>The main parts of a table are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Table number.</p>
<p>Every table should have a number, and the
tables should be numbered consecutively throughout a
document.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Title.</p>
<p>The title should be brief but descriptive. It should not
be a complete sentence, but a collection of words that
indicate the subject of the table: “Percentage of Women
Aged 45-60 Who Smoke, by Educational Attainment,” or
“Effect of Class Size on Student Achievement: OLS
Regression Results,” or “Summary of Income Data from
Survey in Rural Georgia, 1920–1945.”</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Column heads.</p>
<p>Every column of information should have a
column head, a word or phrase that identifies the
information. Columns are read down. Spanner heads are
used when column heads are in two or more levels, that is,
when there are both a collective head and individual heads.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Stub.</p>
<p>The stub is the very left-most column in a table.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Body.</p>
<p>The body of a table consists of the columns to the
right of the stub and below the column heads.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Footnotes.</p>
<p>There are three main kinds of footnotes that may
be included at the end of a table. A source note identifies
either the source of the data used in the table or, if the table
was reproduced without change from a published work, the
published work (it is possible that both things need to be
identified). To reproduce a table without change from a
published work that is still protected by copyright requires
formal permission. General notes apply to the table as a
whole. Specific notes pertain to specific numbers or rows or
columns in the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Rules.</p>
<p>Rules are the lines that visually separate the table
into parts. In general, only horizontal rules should be used.
Vertical rules may in some cases be necessary, but current
publishing norms require that they be avoided whenever
possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
