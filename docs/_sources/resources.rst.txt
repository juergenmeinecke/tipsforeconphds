Essential Reading
===================

A helpful general purpose book is **Thomson, William. A Guide for the Young Economist, 2nd edition,
Cambridge: MIT Press, 2011.** Here the sales pitch: *This book is an invaluable handbook for young
economists working on their dissertations, preparing their first articles for submission to
professional journals, getting ready for their first presentations at conferences and job seminars,
or undertaking their first refereeing assignments.*

Consider buying it!

Here are some good sources with a particular focus on *writing*:

A strongly opinionated piece is offered by **Cochrane, John H.: Writing Tips for PhD students,
2005**, available online somewhere. Informative. Strongly opinonated. Entertaining. Read
selectively.

Another useful one is **A Guide to Writing in Economics** by Paul Dudenhefer. A correlated version
of this text may be **On Economics Writing** by the same author. Both are available online, check
them out.

If you want to sharpen your English writing skills (and you should!), you must read the tiny yet
indispensable **Strunk and White. The Elements of Style**. A classic.
